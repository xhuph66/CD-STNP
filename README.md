This code for the paper "Image Change Detection Based on Stochastic Numerical P Systems"
You can just Run the main file and select the dataset,and Remember to select three images
Which are two Source images and just one reference image.

The best threshold in the experiment is recorded below:
the Bern dataset:result_gbestmin=1.00045881964616
the Ottawa dataset:result_gbestmin=1.16346961117736
the Y-1 dataset:result_gbestmin=0.604564962549288
the Y-2 dataset:result_gbestmin=0.795933132933119
Note: the difference image of the calculation index is the im_di after sampling and filtering
